<h1>IndieHackers ZA</h1>

<p>Indie Hackers ( https://indiehackers.com ) is a community of makers working together to build profitable online businesses. Learn from fellow makers and connect with others who are starting and growing their own companies. We currently have an active chapter in Cape Town meeting once per month, and plan to soon expand to Johannesburg as well.</p>
